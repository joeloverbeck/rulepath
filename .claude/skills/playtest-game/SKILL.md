# Playtest Game

Drive one game hard through the web app to surface and fix defects. Built to run under `/loop`: **each loop fire performs exactly one playtest iteration**, picks up where the last fire left off via a `/tmp` journal, and either continues, stops the loop (spec needed), or ends the loop (two clean iterations).

```
/loop 10m /playtest-game <game>
```

<HARD-GATE>
These hold on every iteration and are never relaxed, including under auto/loop operation:

- **TDD, never weaken tests.** Every bug fix is a failing test FIRST, then the code change that makes it pass. Never delete, skip, weaken, or adapt a test to get green — follow the failing-test protocol (`docs/AGENT-DISCIPLINE.md` §4). Never adapt tests to match a bug; fix the code.
- **Rust owns behavior.** Fixes to legality, validation, effects, scoring, terminal detection, RNG, serialization, views, or bot choices go in `engine-core`/`game-stdlib`/`games/*` — never TypeScript. TypeScript/React present only.
- **Stay inside the boundary.** `engine-core` stays generic and noun-free; typed nouns live in `games/*`. No YAML/DSL, no hidden-information leaks, keep replay/hashes/RNG/serialization deterministic. When in doubt, **stop and reassess rather than generalize** (FOUNDATIONS §12).
- **Never emit a false loop-completion signal** to escape the loop. Only declare a stop/end when its condition is genuinely and unequivocally true (see §6).
- **Deliver complete files or coherent complete sections, not diffs.**
</HARD-GATE>

## Before anything: read the law

On the **first** iteration of a run (and after any context reset), read enough of the foundations to fix correctly:

- `docs/FOUNDATIONS.md` — the constitution (priority order, §11 invariants, §12 stop conditions, §13 ADR triggers).
- `docs/AGENT-DISCIPLINE.md` — bounded tasks, forbidden changes, the failing-test protocol.
- The game's own docs under `games/<folder>/docs/*` — at minimum `RULES.md`, `MECHANICS.md`, `HOW-TO-PLAY.md`, and `UI.md`. Read until you are **100% certain** how the game is supposed to behave. If the docs leave a behavior genuinely undetermined, that is a spec-worthy gap (§6), not a guess.

Record in the journal that you've read these so later iterations don't re-derive from scratch. If a later fire finds the journal already records `Law + docs read: yes` **and** its captured rule summary is still in your context, trust it — re-read the foundations and game docs only when the journal is absent, or when your context was actually reset/compacted and that summary is no longer available. (A fresh `/loop` fire that retained context is not a reset.)

## Process flow (one iteration = one loop fire)

```
Resolve game + slug
        |
        v
Locate / create the journal  (decide: continue this run, or start a fresh version)
        |
        v
[first iteration only] Read law + game docs to 100% certainty
        |
        v
Serve the web app + drive it with Puppeteer; play one or more games to completion
        |
        v
Defect found? --yes--> spec-worthy? --yes--> write specs/* + STOP THE LOOP
        |                    |
        no                   no--> fix via TDD; commit each unit to main
        |
        v
Update the journal (games played, bugs, clean/not-clean, consecutive-clean count)
        |
        v
Two consecutive clean iterations? --yes--> END THE LOOP
        |
        no--> let the next loop fire run the next iteration
```

### 1. Resolve the game and slug

Accept either a `games/*` folder name (`starbridge_crossing`) or its hyphen slug (`starbridge-crossing`). Resolve to the actual `games/<folder>/` directory; if it doesn't exist, list `games/` and stop with a clear error. Derive the **slug** by replacing `_` with `-` (`starbridge_crossing` → `starbridge-crossing`) — the slug is used for the journal filename and matches the docs/specs naming convention.

### 2. Locate or create the journal

The journal coordinates work across loop fires. It lives at `/tmp/<slug>-vN.md`.

- List `/tmp/<slug>-v*.md` and find the highest `N`.
- **None exists** → create `/tmp/<slug>-v1.md` with `Status: ACTIVE` (see format below).
- **Highest is `Status: ACTIVE`** → this is the current run's journal; **append** this iteration to it.
- **Highest is `Status: ENDED` or `Status: STOPPED`** → the previous run finished; this is a fresh run, so **bump the version**: create `/tmp/<slug>-v{N+1}.md` with `Status: ACTIVE`.

This makes the version bump happen once per fresh `/loop` invocation, while iterations within one loop accumulate in a single document.

**Journal format:**

```markdown
# Playtest journal — <slug> — v<N>
Status: ACTIVE            # ACTIVE | STOPPED | ENDED
Game folder: games/<folder>
Loop cron job: <id-or-none>   # fixed-interval /loop cron id, recorded on the first fire so any later fire can cancel it on stop/end
Consecutive clean iterations: 0
Law + docs read: yes/no

## Iteration <k> — <what was done>
- Games played: <count + brief outcome, e.g. "2 games to terminal, seat A won both">
- Bugs found: <list, or "none">
- Fixes (TDD): <one line per fix + commit short-sha>
- Verdict: CLEAN | FIXED <n> | BLOCKED
- Notes for next iteration: <anything the next fire needs>
```

### 3. Serve and drive the web app

- **Cheap sweep first.** A quick `simulate`/`replay-check`/`fixture-check`/`rule-coverage` run for the game (the §4 gate commands) is a low-cost way to surface or rule out defects before the slower UI play.
- Build and serve the web shell locally: `npm --prefix apps/web run build`, then serve `apps/web/dist` on `127.0.0.1`. `npm --prefix apps/web run preview` works in principle, but in this repo's base-path config `vite preview` has been observed to return the SPA `index.html` fallback (content-type `text/html`) for hashed JS/CSS/`.wasm` assets, leaving a blank page that never mounts (`window.render_game_to_text` undefined); the reliable mechanism is the static server the e2e smoke embeds — serve `dist` with per-extension MIME types (`.wasm` → `application/wasm`, …) and an `index.html` fallback. After serving, confirm the app actually mounted (`typeof window.render_game_to_text === "function"` and the catalog renders), not just that the server returns 200. Reuse the running server across iterations if it's already up — but first confirm it is actually serving Rulepath (check the page title / catalog), not an unrelated dev server squatting on a shared port. Reuse confirms *identity* (is it Rulepath?), not *currency* (is it the current build?): if any source changed since the server started — a fix landed between runs, or you're regression-testing a merge — rebuild and restart the preview before driving it, because a stale server can re-confirm an already-fixed bug or fake a pass. When in doubt, rebuild; it's cheap relative to a wrong verdict.
- Never block on a foreground `sleep` for **any** wait — server startup, render settle, autoplay terminal — it is harness-blocked. Use a background task (`run_in_background`) with a readiness poll, or an in-page `Promise`/`setTimeout` loop inside `puppeteer_evaluate`.
- **Lean on the game's e2e smoke.** If the game ships `apps/web/e2e/<slug>.smoke.mjs`, run it for fast baseline coverage and read it to learn stable selectors (e.g. `data-*` space ids, legal-target classes) and the start-match flow before manual exploration. The smoke is the floor, not the ceiling — then go beyond it.
- Drive it with the Puppeteer MCP tools (`puppeteer_navigate`, `_click`, `_select`, `_fill`, `_screenshot`, `_evaluate`). Navigate to the catalog, select **this** game, and play **one or more complete games to a terminal state** — as many as you judge useful to exercise the rules.
  - **Read after render, never in the same call as a click.** React re-renders asynchronously, so a `puppeteer_evaluate` that dispatches a click and then reads the board or `render_game_to_text()` in the *same* call returns **stale** state and can fake a defect. Click in one call; read in a separate call (or await a tick / `waitForFunction`).
  - **Interact precisely; mind SVG.** Prefer targeted interaction over bare-tag selectors — `puppeteer_click('button')` hits the *first* match on the page and can select the wrong game or control; instead match by text / `aria-label` / `data-*` inside `puppeteer_evaluate`. On SVG boards, `el.click()` is undefined and `el.className` is an `SVGAnimatedString` (not a string) — dispatch `new MouseEvent('click', {bubbles:true})` and read classes via `getAttribute('class')`.
  - **Reaching terminal on long games.** When a game is too long to hand-play to a terminal (e.g. a multi-thousand-ply race), use the shell's **Bot vs bot** mode + **Start Autoplay**, then wait for terminal status by polling inside `puppeteer_evaluate` (a `Promise`/`setTimeout` loop on the Rust view status) or via a background task — never a foreground `sleep` (see the no-foreground-`sleep` rule above).
- **Delegating impractical-to-reach states.** Some legal states are impractical to construct by hand (deep hop chains, rare forced passes, a specific terminal race). When you cannot reach one through the UI in reasonable effort, it is acceptable to rely on the game's e2e smoke and golden traces for that branch instead of forcing it through the browser — record in the journal *which* branch you delegated and to *what* coverage, so the gap is visible rather than silent.
- Watch for defects of every kind: wrong legal actions, illegal moves accepted, mis-scored or mis-detected terminals, desynced/incorrect views, broken or misleading UI, non-deterministic or leaking behavior, crashes, console errors. Screenshot anything suspicious into the journal's evidence trail (MCP `puppeteer_screenshot` returns the image inline — reference it by the `name` you give it, or save the data URI to the scratchpad for a resolvable path).

### 4. Fix defects via TDD, commit each unit

For each defect:

1. Confirm it against the game docs — is the *implementation* wrong, or your understanding? Re-read the relevant `docs/*` rather than assume.
2. Write a **failing test first** at the right layer (`docs/TESTING-REPLAY-BENCHMARKING.md` — unit, rule, golden trace, property, simulation, replay, serialization, visibility/no-leak, bot-legality, or UI smoke).
3. Fix the **Rust** behavior (or the presentation layer only if the defect is genuinely presentational) so the test passes, staying inside the kernel/boundary law.
4. Run the relevant gates before committing (per `CLAUDE.md` §Commands: `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`, and the per-game `simulate`/`replay-check`/`fixture-check`/`rule-coverage` for this game).
5. **Commit each distinct unit of work to `main`** with a focused message. One logical fix = one commit. Stage only the files for this unit; do not sweep up unrelated working-tree changes.

### 5. Update the journal

Append the iteration entry. Set `Verdict: CLEAN` only if you played to completion and found **no** bug to fix this iteration. Update `Consecutive clean iterations`: increment on a CLEAN verdict, reset to 0 on any FIXED/BLOCKED.

### 6. Stop conditions

Two distinct terminations — apply whichever fires first:

- **Spec needed → STOP THE LOOP.** If a defect is not a quick fix but a deficiency requiring design (a missing mechanic, an ambiguous/undefined rule, a contract or boundary question, anything tripping a FOUNDATIONS §12 stop condition or §13 ADR trigger), do **not** hack it: write a spec under `specs/*` aligned with `docs/**` and the `specs/README.md` conventions, commit it (with any `specs/README.md` tracker row) as its own unit per step 5 above — staging only those spec files, set the journal `Status: STOPPED`, record the spec path, and **stop the loop**. A shared-surface UI policy with several viable designs is a typical spec-worthy case; committing to one bound by editing a magic constant would be the hack this bullet forbids.
- **Two clean iterations → END THE LOOP.** When `Consecutive clean iterations` reaches **2**, the game is shaken out for now: set the journal `Status: ENDED` and **end the loop**.

**How to signal the loop to stop/end:** finish the iteration with an explicit, unambiguous terminal line as the very last thing you output, e.g. `PLAYTEST LOOP ENDED: <slug> — two consecutive clean iterations` or `PLAYTEST LOOP STOPPED: <slug> — spec written to specs/<file>`. Do not schedule another iteration (in self-paced `/loop`, omit the next wakeup). If the loop is a fixed-interval `/loop` that keeps re-firing, the terminal line plus `Status: ENDED/STOPPED` in the journal tells the next fire to no-op. If you know the loop's cron job id (recorded as `Loop cron job` in the journal header, or still in your context from creating it), proactively `CronDelete` it so it stops firing no-ops; otherwise surface that the user can cancel the interval. Never emit a terminal line whose condition isn't genuinely met (HARD-GATE).

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not implement a game from scratch or add new mechanics — spec-worthy work routes to `specs/*` and stops the loop.
- It does not decide legality, validation, or any behavior in TypeScript.
- It does not weaken, skip, or delete tests to get green.
- It does not commit a spec-and-stop and a fix in the same breath without recording both in the journal.
